# AI in Robotics: Image Processing and CNNs 🤖📚

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **AI in Robotics** course, specifically focusing on the chapter about Image Processing, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transfer Learning.

## 📖 Chapter Contents
This chapter provides a comprehensive guide to:
- **Image and Image Preprocessing**: Understanding and manipulating images to enhance model performance.
- **Image Augmentation**: Techniques to increase the diversity of your training set by applying random (but realistic) transformations.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks**: Basics to advanced concepts in CNNs.
- **Image Classification Task**: Implementing and training models to classify images.
- **Advanced Convolutional Architectures**: Dive into complex models like ResNet.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging pre-trained models to solve similar problems more efficiently.

We utilize the powerful **PyTorch** and **TorchVision** frameworks for all coding implementations.
