## üìò Course Overview

This comprehensive course provides an in-depth exploration of various AI technologies applied in the field of robotics. By combining theoretical knowledge with practical implementations, students will gain a robust understanding of how to enhance robotic systems with AI capabilities. Key topics include:

### Computer Vision (CV) in Robotics
- Detailed exploration of how computer vision enables robots to perceive and interpret their environment. Topics cover both the underlying principles and the application of CV technologies in real-world robotic scenarios.

### CNNs and Image Classification
- Examination of Convolutional Neural Networks for their pivotal role in recognizing objects and scenes, which are crucial for autonomous robotic functions.

### Object Detection
- Introduction to state-of-the-art object detection techniques that allow robots to identify and locate various objects within their environment effectively.

### Object Segmentation
- Study of advanced segmentation methods that enable precise identification and differentiation of objects within an image, crucial for detailed environmental interaction.

### Object Tracking
- Techniques and algorithms for tracking objects across a sequence of images or video frames, which is vital for interactive and responsive robotic behaviors.

### Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Comprehensive coverage of Reinforcement Learning, teaching robots to make decisions based on their actions and outcomes to achieve specific goals.

### Making RL/CV-based System for Robot Planning and Control
- Integration of RL and CV technologies to develop sophisticated systems that plan and control robotic actions based on complex inputs and learning experiences.

### Simulator for Practical Experience
- Utilization of the Webots simulator to provide a realistic environment where students can test and observe the behavior of their robotic models without the need for physical hardware.
